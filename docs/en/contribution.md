# Thank you for taking the time to help

Despite being a system I use for all of my own deploys and being open source, having a great community is the key to open-source. As with all great ideas, at the moment this project is more of my "opinion" of a "great project" idea than anything. And you know what they [say about opinions...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVlYMctb7Y4) I would like to cordially invite you to help. If you've made it this far thank you in advance. There is a lot we can do to help make the lives of other devs easy, and save them some money in the process, with some good devops.

### Golden Rule

I love a good joke but be respectful to everyone **(full-stop)** that contributes, or uses the project. Like seriously... It's about the only rule that matters in open-source. No one is above this.

### The Big Picture

Aside from that feel free to do or say anything that you feel will lead to a better outcome. Feel free to help with everything from docs to full rewrites of sections of logic or updating dependencies, suggesting dependency alternatives, suggesting features or integrations, writing unit tests, etc. It's up to you. You do not need to be a Sr. Developer to help either. If you are new to development there are some learning resources on the docs, under the [Glossary & Links](https://devops.nomad.house/contributions/glossary.html). Please utilize github issues for requests or discussions, and adhere to the standard fork and PR processes for code changes. Its best to email one of the maintainers, listed below, if you have submitted an issue or PR, [though github](https://github.com/matthewkeil/nomad-devops/issues), and it has been more than 72 hours and no one has gotten back to you.
